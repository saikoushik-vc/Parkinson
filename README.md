			PARKINSON'S DISEASE DETECTION BASED ON ANALYSIS OF SPEECH

	Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a long-term chronic disorder of the central nervous system that mainly affects the motor system. It disturbs the nerve cells in the brain that produces dopamine. The very first symptoms of Parkinson’s disease include changes in speech, muscle rigidity and tremors. When Parkinson’s Disease treatment is administered early, it is significantly more effective. Unfortunately, it is challenging to detect the disease at its early stage and when symptoms can usually be seen it is too late. Since approximately 90% of the people with PD suffer from speech disorders, speech analysis is considered the most common technique for this aim. The system does not require any special skillset for users to operate it. It is designed to be user friendly and cost-effective.
